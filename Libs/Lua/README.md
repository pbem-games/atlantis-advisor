A fork of the pLua project, created by Jeremy Darling (@jdarling) and originally hosted at eonclash.com.

This modification includes many additions and fixes and has been updated for Delphi XE2 or higher. It still compiles and works with the older, non-Unicode Delphi releases.

It has been mostly tested with Lua 5.1.4 (64-bit and 32-bit).

pLua is a long term effort to build a set of methods (functions and procedures), objects, and types to aid Pascal Developers (FPC, Lazarus, and Delphi at the moment) in the implementation of Lua in their projects.

## What is Lua #

Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C (that is, in the common subset of ANSI C and C++). 

Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the host. This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called lua, which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter. 

Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated in its license.

For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at [Lua's web site](http://www.lua.org). For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua, see Roberto's book, Programming in Lua (Second Edition).
