      <p class="section"> <b>Environment </b> </p>
      <h2><a name="GameManager"></a>Game Manager</h2>
      <h3><a name="GameStructure"></a>Structure of the Game</h3>
      <p>In Advisor, Game is folder like Advisor/sample game with all game data. 
        Important files inside the folder is: <b>game.dat</b> - database for all 
        game items, skills, map etc; <b>scripts.txt</b> - all scripts for the 
        game. These files may be edited in text editor. Also this folder by default 
        keeps all game order and report files.</p>
      <p>There is some predefined rulesets (databases) available on game creation: 
        standard.dat, ceran.dat and conquest.dat. That's actually files in Advisor 
        root folder, which will be copied to newly created game folder. The rulesets 
        contains most information available in game rules and will <i>never</i> 
        contain any data for advanced items.</p>
      <h3><a name="UsingManager"></a>Using Manager</h3>
      <p>First, you should create a game. In unregistered version you can't create 
        more than one game, so delete Sample Game and then create new one. Note 
        that when you removing a game, files will not be actually deleted, so 
        you'll not lost an information. If you want to completely destroy a game, 
        remove it from Manager and then manually delete game folder.</p>
      <p>Then, add reports to the game. You may add report files from disk or 
        paste report from clipboard. In latter case, report will be saved to game 
        folder. You may set option to automatically rename all opened files and 
        move them to game folder; see Options | Manager.</p>
      <p>When all reports added, you should parse them to transfer data from text 
        files into memory. To do it, press Read button. Parse log is shown on 
        the right; blue triangle on the bottom hides or shows the log. Review 
        the log if there is errors on report parsing. </p>
      <p>Advisor usually keeps some last reports and kicks out old ones from the 
        game. You can't view unit disposition from kicked (archived) reports, 
        but all valuable data (skill reports, map etc) is stored in game database 
        and available.</p>
      <p>Another feature is loading orders for last turn. After parsing all reports, 
        Advisor will scan Game/Orders folder for last turn order file, and load 
        found orders. So, if you saved orders and then reopened game, no orders 
        will be lost.</p>
      <h3><a name="ManagerOptions"></a>Options</h3>
      <p><b>Keep N last reports</b> - amount of newer reports to keep in memory; 
        all other will be archived.</p>
      <p><b>Move reports to game folder</b> - when you adding report files from 
        disk, Advisor will automatically rename them and move to game folder.</p>
      <p><b>Prompt to remove wrong reports</b> - Game Manager will ask you to 
        kick files from batch if they are not recognized as reports.</p>
      <p><b>Try to load order</b> - Advisor will scan Game/Orders folder for last 
        turn orders and load them while parsing.</p>
      <h3><a name="SetupGame"></a>Setting up new game</h3>
      <p>When you created new game and parsed first report, do following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open File | Options.</li>
        <li>Change game password.</li>
        <li>Check if Faction Points sequence matches your game's one (see game 
          rules for your server).</li>
        <li>If you know map dimensions for the game, enter them now.</li>
        <li>If you are registered user, fill in E-Mail data for Send Order command.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2> <a name="MainWindow"></a>Main Window Interface</h2>
      <h3><a name="Map"></a>Map</h3>
      <p>Map has many display options, available from map toolbar right above 
        it or from Map menu.</p>
      <p>Right-click and drag to move map to another position. Double-click to 
        center a region. Press Home to center on selected region. Bookmarks allows 
        to quickly navigate to bookmarked regions.</p>
      <p>You can select map level (surface, underworld etc) from drop-down list 
        near Level button or from Map menu. Level button or &quot;Map | Level 
        down&quot; selects next level from list. If you want to follow a shaft 
        rather then just select next level, double-click a shaft in object list.</p>
      <p>In &quot;autodetect size&quot; mode, map shows the regions you already 
        explored, plus 4-hex border around them to allow units move further. Map 
        is cylindric, cycled from east to west. If you found a margin of the map 
        (last eastern or southern region), you may manually set map size to remove 
        4-hex border. Open Options, set Manual Map Dimension for selected level, 
        then enter map size (coordinates of last south-eastern region plus 1 for 
        each dimension).</p>
      <p>Mini Map (&quot;View | Mini Map&quot;) used for fast world navigation; 
        clicking on Mini Map centers clicked region on main map. Red rectangle 
        on Mini Map shows visible area in main map.</p>
      <h3><a name="ObjectList"></a>Object list</h3>
      <p>This list is to the left of map and shows structures in selected region. 
        If structure is not finished (needs further building), it has small number 
        of material units Needs. If there is units inside, structure icon also 
        has flag of owner faction. Double-click a shaft here to open a region 
        shaft leads to.</p>
      <h3><a name="UnitGrid"></a>Unit Grid</h3>
      <p>See also: <a href="#Grids">Grids</a>, <a href="#Environment">Options 
        | Environment</a></p>
      <p>This grid shows units in currently selected region. There is some special 
        columns. Custom column shows part of unit report as it appears in report 
        file; contents of this column may be defined in Options. Attack shows 
        attack level of unit (skill level plus weapon modifiers); Defence - best 
        armor defence rate.</p>
      <p>If unit's faction is invisible, but was recorded in previous turns (see 
        <a href="#Tracking">Unit Tracking</a>), it will be shown with ? sign, 
        in colors of unknown faction. If unit has fought in battle, it will be 
        marked with sword icon; if it has dead men (in battle or starved) - with 
        cross icon; mages additionaly marked with mage icon.</p>
      <p>Sorting by Faction and Faction Num columns is special: player's faction 
        acts like it has minimal possible number and name, so it will appear first 
        on ascending sort. </p>
      <p>Above Unit Grid placed toolbar with grid tools. You may filter only one 
        faction to show here, or switch in Faction Mode (&quot;View | Faction 
        Mode&quot;) to show all units of selected faction in all regions. Latter 
        is useful when you want to find lost unit or check month orders for whole 
        faction.</p>
      <p>Right-click on Unit Grid opens menu with unit orders. This menu contains 
        only orders the unit can complete (for example, only mages has Cast option). 
        Shift-clicking an item instead of normal click makes command repeating 
        (like &quot;@work&quot;). &quot;Repeating&quot; flag inverses this behavior: 
        all commands become repeating, shift-clicked - non-repeating. Many orders 
        from this meny may be invoked with keyboard shortcuts; see <a href="#Shortcuts">Options 
        | Shortcuts</a>.</p>
      <p>When issuing Move, Advance and Sail orders, you should click the regions 
        on map which unit should move through. Red frame on the map in this mode 
        shows the regions available to enter. Click on already visited region 
        to complete order. Issuing another move order cancels all previously issued 
        ones.</p>
      <h3><a name="RegionInfo"></a>Region information</h3>
      <p>This panel contains information about selected region. On the top you 
        see icon for current month weather and land name. Then comes region information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hex.</b> Terrain and coords; for regions not visible in current 
          turn, also last month when they were visible.</li>
        <li><b>Settlement</b>. Region settlement, if any.</li>
        <li><b>Peasants.</b> Inhabitants of region.</li>
        <li><b>Tax Rate.</b> Amount of money available to collect with TAX command. 
          Grayed numbers is: amount of taxers in region (if any) / amount of men 
          to collect all tax money. If amount of taxers is more than enough for 
          region, income per taxer will come in (brackets).</li>
        <li><b>Wages.</b> Payment for WORKing men.</li>
        <li><b>Max Wages.</b> Amount of money for all workers. Grayed is amount 
          of working men (if any) / amount of men to collect all money / income 
          per man in brackets.</li>
        <li><b>Entertainment.</b> Amount of money available to collect with entertainment. 
          Grayed is amount of entertainers multiplied by skill level (if any) 
          / amount to collect all money / income per level in brackets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All calculations for taxers, workers and entertainers taking into account 
        only player's faction, because other faction's units' orders are unknown.</p>
      <p>Then comes grid for items available to produce in the region. Double-click 
        on this and following grids opens Item Editor. Resources without amount 
        shown in strikeout font is advanced resources which may appear in this 
        type of terrain, but wasn't found in the region (see <a href="#AnalyzingResources">Analyzing 
        Resources</a>)</p>
      <p>Next is grids for items Wanted and For Sale here. Empty Amount column 
        in For Sale grid means &quot;unlimited&quot;. If units buys or sells items, 
        amount will be shown here as &quot;Currently Wanted/All Wanted&quot;. 
        For example, if a unit sells 1 sword from wanted 10, number is &quot;9/10&quot;. 
      </p>
      <p>Notes tab opens region notes. These notes are valuable only inside Advisor. 
        If Map | Show Region Notes is on, notes will be shown as hints when mouse 
        cursor is over the region on the map.</p>
      <h3><a name="UnitInfo"></a>Unit information</h3>
      <p>This panel shows info for unit currently selected in grid. On the top 
        is unit's name, number, and description (line below name). Name and description 
        may be edited right here. Description line may work in two modes, selected 
        by button with green head. If head is in normal level, description is 
        regular game description. If it is down, description is local and will 
        not be shown to other players. You may assign local descriptions to any 
        unit, including units of other players.</p>
      <p>Then comes unit flags.</p>
      <p>Item grid shows unit inventory. Items in this grid is sorted by item 
        index (see Item Editor). Double-click opens Item Editor. You may give 
        items to another units by dragging them to unit grid or discard (GIVE 
        0) them by dragging to map (see <a href="#Give">GIVE</a>). Items bought 
        during this turn is grayed and can't be given. Right-click opens popup 
        menu with advanced GIVE options: for example, by selecting &quot;Give 
        to Riding&quot; you will command target unit to accept no more items than 
        it can carry when riding.</p>
      <p>There is two special types of items, shown here: trade income and work 
        income. Basically, that's money unit earns this turn.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>trade income</b> - money from TAX, PILLAGE and SELL. Counted for 
          BUY, STUDY and mainentance.</li>
        <li><b>work income</b> - money from ENTERTAIN and WORK. Counted for STUDY 
          and mainentance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can't give income money to other units, because GIVE order are processed 
        before other ones.</p>
      <p>Item Grid usually displays all modifications in unit's items: when you 
        sell or give items, amount will change or item will disappear. If you 
        wish to have amount of items as they appears in report (without any modifications), 
        choose &quot;View | Unmodified item amounts&quot;. Unmodified amounts 
        are grayed.</p>
      <p>By dragging icons below Item Grid, you may issue masked GIVE orders: 
        GIVE ALL ITEMS, GIVE ALL WEAPON/ARMOR, and GIVE ALL TRADE. &quot;Give 
        spoils&quot; icon works slightly different: it issues one order for each 
        &quot;spoil&quot; item. &quot;Spoils&quot; is any items except silver, 
        men, weapons, armor, mounts, and misc combat items.</p>
      <p>Skill grid shows unit skills. &quot;Can Study&quot; skills for mages 
        are<font color="#999999"> grayed</font>, Combat Spell are marked with 
        casting hand icon. Double-click on the grid opens Skill Editor; right-click 
        shows skill context menu. Note that behavior of this menu is similar to 
        unit's: shift-clicking Study will issue &quot;@study&quot; command.</p>
      <p>Load tab shows unit load and capacity for various types of movement. 
        Numbers near Wagons icon is amount of wagons used (supplied with a horse) 
        / full amount of wagons. Then comes calculations for walking, riding, 
        flying, and transport. If unit can move this way, numbers are following: 
        &quot;1 (max 5)&quot;, which means: &quot;Load 1, Capacity 5&quot;. For 
        Transport (Ship) movement, numbers are: &quot;5/15 (max 200)&quot;, which 
        means: &quot;Unit weight in ship 5, full ship Load 15, ship Capacity 200&quot;. 
      </p>
      <h3><a name="ObjectInfo"></a>Object information</h3>
      <p>This panel contains information for structure selected in Objects List. 
        On the top is structure name, number and description (line below name); 
        name and description may be edited right here. Then comes structure information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Type.</b></li>
        <li><b>Owner. </b> First unit inside.</li>
        <li><b>Defence. </b>For defence structures: amount of men which receives 
          defence bonus when inside.</li>
        <li><b>Men inside.</b></li>
        <li><b>Size.</b> Amount of material units to build the structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Transports: Load is weight of men and items inside; Control is men*skill 
        value to SAIL the ship. For example, both 15 level 1 sailors and 5 level 
        3 sailors gives 15 Control units.</p>
      <p>Shafts are known to have passages to another regions. You may link a 
        shaft to destination region by pressing Link button and selecting a region 
        on map. When Level button (or &quot;Map | Level down&quot;) pressed on 
        a region with shaft, map will show linked region. Shafts will be automatically 
        linked when your units are passing through and server shows their way 
        in Events (see <a href="#AutoLink">Automatic shaft linkage</a>).</p>
      <h3><a name="ItemsinRegion"></a>Receive Items</h3>
      <p>By pressing F5, you may toggle on and off another item grid, containing 
        all items in all faction units in the region, excluding selected one. 
        You may drag items from the grid into unit's items, ant they will be given 
        to the unit. This is useful if you want to collect spoils, load caravan 
        etc. Items in this grid are sorted by item indexes (see Item Editor).</p>
      <h3><a name="Grids"></a>Grids</h3>
      <p>Advisor implements its own type of advanced grids; most cool specimen 
        is Unit Grid. Grids has some common options, though some of them may be 
        disabled.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Sorting.</b> Click on column header sorts the grid by this column. 
          Another click on sorted header changes sort order from ascending to 
          descending. When there is equal rows in column, sorting algorythm will 
          search other columns, from left to right. There is two types of sort 
          for a column: string (1, 10, 2, 20) and numeric (1, 2, 10, 20). Sort 
          type is defined in config file. </li>
        <li><b>Filtering.</b> There is usually buttons to filter something, for 
          example My Faction button for Unit Grid.</li>
        <li><b>Column moving and resizing.</b> Drag column headers to set width 
          and position of colimns.</li>

      <h2>New Unit window</h2>
      <p>See also: <a href="#FormTemplates">FORM Templates</a></p>
      <p>When issuing FORM command from unit menu, you receive the designer window 
        for new unit. The window allows to configure men, silver and flags for 
        the unit.</p>
      <p><b>Flags</b> are copied from creator unit. You may set Delayed Guard 
        and Autotax flags to make unit start taxing from next turn (useful for 
        newly-created units studying Combat). Guard and Avoid flags are exclusive.</p>
      <p><b>Men</b> box is intended to provide men for new unit; you may choose 
        to buy men or take some from other unit in region. When Buy checkbox is 
        checked, Guard and Autotax flags unchecks, because usually newly-bought 
        men can't tax. You may check them again, if you want.</p>
      <p><b>Payment Reqired</b> box provides calculator for unit's funds. &quot;Recruit 
        fee&quot; flag adds amount of money to buy men; &quot;Study&quot; - cost 
        of skill studying; &quot;Mainentance&quot; - unit mainentance for given 
        period. If Autotax flag checked, 50 silver will be subtracted from total 
        sum for each man-month. Delayed Autotax subtracts same value, except for 
        first month.</p>
      <p><b>Silver</b> box allows to take silver from other unit in region or 
        claim.</p>
      <p>You may create many identical units in one shot by specifying number 
        of copies. This allows, for example, to create scouts for all directions.</p>
      <h2><a name="ItemEditor"></a>Item Editor</h2>
      <p>See also: <a href="#Rulesets">Editing Rulesets</a></p>
      <p>This window allows to change item settings. Usually you are not expected 
        to set this up manually, because Advisor reads almost anything from item 
        reports. So, if you want to set up items, press &quot;Request All&quot; 
        button and wait next report with item reports. NB: if you are new player, 
        don't bother, all really essential information will be sent automatically 
        when you'll need it.</p>
      <h3><a name="ItemIndexes"></a>Indexes</h3>
      <p>All items has indexes, or numbers. These indexes used for two purposes: 
        first is sorting items in grids (for example unit's items), and second 
        is preference of combat equipment for Soldiers in Unit, Battle Simulator 
        and army exchanges. Items with lower indexes are usually considered better. 
        Rulesets supplied with Advisor already has all weapons and armors ordered 
        in correct way; <b>do not</b> change this order, or all battle features 
        will work incorrectly. Note that absolute position is not important: for 
        example, plate armor may be #10 or #100, but it must be <b>before</b> 
        chain armor<b>. </b></p>
      <h3><b><a name="ItemFlags"></a>Flags</b></h3>
      <p>Type of an item may be set by combo and some checkboxes. Types in combo 
        are self-explaining; note that <b>Wagon </b>type must be set manually 
        for wagons. Here is the explanation of extra flags.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tool</b>. Item are raising production of other items.</li>
        <li><b>Can't be given</b>. Just that.</li>
        <li><b>Resource</b>. Item doesn't needs raw materials to produce and may 
          be produced in specific types of terrain.</li>
        <li><b>Advanced</b>. This is the resource you can't see and produce with 
          lower skill levels, or the items made from advanced resources (mithril 
          swords are Advanced).</li>
        <li><b>Misc combat item</b>. This item has special combat ability (fire 
          attack, shield etc).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="ItemClasses"></a>Item Classes</h3>
      <p>Item classes (or masks) may be used in GIVE command (i.e. GIVE ALL TRADE) 
        and in Needs. Advisor's understanding of these classes is slightly different 
        than server's and always based on item flags.</p>

      <h3><a name="BattleSim"></a>Battle Viewer/Simulator</h3>
      <p>Battle Viewer is the graphical window which shows you battle disposition. 
        In the left half of window you see two boxes for army leaders (tactics) 
        and the armies themselves. Units are usually shown in appropriate armor, 
        wielding weapons. Small number near unit is the count of men/monsters 
        in. When you are moving mouse over unit or selecting it by clicking, unit 
        details are shown on &quot;Unit&quot; tab. To play animation for battle 
        actions, press Play button.</p>
      <p>Battle Simulator is the tool which helps you to predict results of a 
        battle. You may run it on already concluded battle or create your own 
        situation. When you pressing &quot;Calculate damage&quot; button, Simulator 
        runs 100 battles, and records winners and loses. Then it shows percent 
        of victories for each side. Also, small percent numbers appears near damaged 
        units; for one-man unit they may be considered as possibility to lose 
        this man; for many-man units - as percentage of men which will be most 
        likely lost. You may also view animation for one simulated battle; press 
        Play in simulation mode to do it.</p>
      <p>To run properly, Simulator requires correct settings for weapons, armor 
        and mounts used by combatants. Basically, it will rely on numbers similar 
        to shown in &quot;Soldiers in Unit&quot; window. Proper setup for special 
        abilities and monsters are extremely important, because they may change 
        battle dramatically.</p>

          surface regions. To enable this feature, set <b>Guess Weather</b> flag 
          and define map size for surface. You should enable it as soon as possible, 
          because calculations of move points rely on weather.</li>

          order issued from unit popup menu will remove all previous monthlong 
          orders. For example, if unit has MOVE order and we are issuing WORK, 
          we will have both MOVE and WORK orders without this option and only 
          WORK with it.</li>
        <li><b>Auto-set Needs. </b>This flag enables automatical declaration of

      <p><b>Shortcuts</b></p>
      <p>In this tab, you may define keyboard shortcuts (hot keys) for unit menu 
        and main menu items. To define shortcut, select an order and press desired 
        key combination. </p>
      <p>Shift key has special meaning. Normally, when you selecting an order 
        from menu with Shift pressed, it appears with @. If the order is invoked 
        by shortcut key, Shift has same effect: Shift+Key produces @-order. But 
        what if you always issuing this order with @ (for example, @work)? You 
        may want to add it with single key, not Shift+Key combination. To do this, 
        press Shift when defining shortcut (for bold orders). </p>
      <p class="section">Order Tools</p>
      <h2><a name="OrderTools"></a>Main Window tricks</h2>
      <p>Advisor offers special ways to issue some common orders - smarter than 
        just entering them manually or adding one-by-one from unit menu. Usually 
        these methods allows to issue a bunch of orders in couple clicks.</p>
      <h3><a name="Movement"></a>Movement</h3>
      <p>Movement mode starts when you issuing MOVE, SAIL or ADVANCE command from 
        unit's context menu. In this mode, you can click the regions on map which 
        you would like the unit to move through. Red frame shows regions available 
        for unit; number in unit's current region - remaining movement points; 
        and arrows shows the regions unit can enter right now.</p>
      <p>If men in unit can swim, it will MOVE over water. Otherwise walking units 
        can't leave land. Ships can SAIL in water and coastal regions.</p>
      <p>If unit was inside structure when started MOVE, it will MOVE OUT first.</p>
      <p>While moving, you can enter objects in region. To do it, click an object 
        in left panel. If you clicked a shaft, unit will MOVE IN. If the shaft 
        was linked to another region (see <a href="#ObjectInfo">Object information</a>), 
        map will show linked region and unit will be able to continue movement. 
        Otherwise, movement will be ended.</p>
      <p>To work properly, movement mode requires following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Men and mounts in unit are properly defined in Item Editor (Weight 
          and Movement tab are particulary important);</li>
        <li>Map size is defined manually for surface and Guess Weather mode is 
          on;</li>
        <li>Explored shafts are linked.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="Maintenance"></a>Maintenance</h3>
      <p>Advisor calculates maintenance (upkeep) for moving units 
        by target region. Consider unit without silver. It will 
        automatically take silver from units in same region to 
        avoid starvation. When unit moving, it will take money 
        from units in target region. </p>
      <p>To view units arriving in selected region, select &quot;View 
        | Arriving units&quot;. This option is useful when you 
        receive Advisor warning &quot;No money for maintenance&quot;, 
        which points to empty region, being target of one or more 
        units. </p>
      <h3><a name="Give"></a>Drag-n-drop GIVE</h3>
      <p>GIVE interface based on Item Grid of <a href="#UnitInfo">Unit Info Panel</a>. 
        You may GIVE items by dragging them from item grid onto target unit in 
        unit grid or discard (GIVE 0) them by dragging to map. You may also toggle 
        <a href="#ItemsInRegion">Receive Items</a> grid on and drag items from 
        there to Item Grid.</p>
      <p>Hold Shift when relesing item to issue @GIVE order. Hold Alt to issue 
        GIVE ALL order. Both keys results in @GIVE ALL.</p>
      <p>&quot;Give:&quot; box below item grid shows amount to give. By dragging 
        icons below the grid, you issuing &quot;GIVE ALL ITEMS&quot;, &quot;GIVE 
        ALL WEAPON, ARMOR&quot; and &quot;GIVE ALL TRADE&quot; orders, respectively. 
      </p>
      <p>Right-clicking on grid pops up menu with advanced GIVE options. For example, 
        when you selecting &quot;Give to Riding&quot; option, target unit will 
        accept no more given items thain it can carry when riding.</p>
      <p>Note that GIVE orders will take into account position of items before 
        any turn processing. Consider example. Unit A has 10 swords and gives 
        5 swords to unit B. Then unit B gives 2 swords to unit C. </p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit A</td>
          <td>10 swords</td>
          <td>give B 5 swords</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit B</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>give C 2 swords</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit C</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Normally, this sequence will throw an error, because B doesn't have a 
        swords when processing starts. But if you issued the orders with drag-and-drop, 
        they will actually look like this:</p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit A</td>
          <td>10 swords</td>
          <td>give B 3 swords<br>
            give C 2 swords </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit B</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>Unit C</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3><a name="Armies"></a>Armies</h3>
      <p>Army is a group of units which should move together - in other words,

      <ul>
        <li>To make an army, open &quot;View | Armies&quot; and click +.</li>
        <li>To command units to join an army, choose &quot;Army

        <li>To move all army units in region together, choose 
          &quot;Army | Move Army&quot; in popup menu of any army 
          unit. Army will move with speed of slowest unit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="FormTemplates"></a>FORM Templates</h3>
      <p>If you often create some type of units, for example scouts or taxing 
        squads, you may want to write template for this units and then create 
        them in one click. To do this, set up new unit as usual, and then press 
        &quot;Save as Template&quot; button near unit name in <a href="#NewUnit">New 
        Unit window</a>. You will create template with name given to this unit. 
        Now you may open &quot;Form&quot; submenu in Unit Menu (right below Form 
        New item) and choose saved template. </p>
      <p>Templates could be modified in Options | Environment. Note that template 
        contains some wildcard strings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>%N - number of new unit</li>
        <li>%PEASANTS - name of peasants of current region</li>
        <li>%RECRUITFEE(amount) - cost of men bought * amount</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="AutoOrders"></a>Automatic orders</h2>
      <p>Instead of <a href="scripts.html">OrderScript</a>, Advisor has some built-in 
        features to automatically perform some common tasks. These features has 
        no support on server, they are inner matter of Advisor.</p>
      <h3><a name="Needs"></a>Needs</h3>
      <p>Each unit in your faction needs a set of items to complete its tasks. 
        STUDYing units needs silver, PRODUCEing units needs tools and raw materials, 
        armies needs weapons and horses. Normally you are providing these items 
        manually, by issuing multiple GIVE commands. Advisor allows you to define 
        units' needs; these units will automatically request needed items from 
        the neighbours.</p>
      <p>Technically, to declare needs, you should add special &quot;@;needs&quot; 
        comment to unit's orders. You may do it from wizard: select &quot;Specials 
        | Declare Needs&quot; from unit popup menu. Also, needs may be automatically 
        declared with each monthlong order; to enable this feature, set the flag

      <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999">@;needs</font></b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999"> 
        amount [usable] [unneeded] items1[, amount [usable] [unneeded] items2, 
        ...][, <b>priority</b> N]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999"><b>@;needs equipment</b>[, 
        <b>priority</b> N]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999"><b>@;needs nogive</b></font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>amount</b> is number of items (like 10), &quot;all&quot;, or &quot;enough&quot; 
        (equal to amount of men in unit).</p>
      <p><b>usable</b> means unit will need only items it can use (units without 
        Crossbow skill will not consider crossbows Usable).</p>
      <p><b>unneeded</b> means unit will take only unneeded items. Note: if unit 
        has no declared needs, it needs all its items (with priority 1). But if 
        unit declared needs to some items, all other items will be considered 
        Unneeded.</p>
      <p><b>items</b> may be name of item (like &quot;silver&quot;), or item class 
        - same that in GIVE command, with one exception: &quot;items&quot; will 
        not select neither men nor silver. Normally, you shouldn't declare men 
        as needs. Needs has two special item classes: Spoils and Materials (see 
        <a href="#ItemClasses">item classes</a>).</p>
      <p><b>priority</b> defines strict order for units to take specific items. 
        If no priority given, priority is 0. Higher priority takes first.</p>
      <p>&quot;@;needs <b>equipment</b>&quot;, is equal to &quot;@;needs enough 
        usable weapons, enough armor, enough mounts&quot;.</p>
      <p>&quot;@;needs <b>nogive</b>&quot; means unit will not give anything to 
        anyone (automatically). It still may take items, if other needs declared.</p>
      <p>Examples: </p>

      <p><b>What if unit has choice?</b></p>
      <p>If unit declared, say, &quot;@;needs enough weapons&quot;, and has a 
        choice between crossbows and swords, it will prefer (in that order):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Weapon it skilled with (crossbow, if has Crossbow skill)</li>
        <li>Ranged weapon, if unit is Behind.</li>
        <li>Item with bigger total bonus for unit's skills (combat, riding etc; 
          Behind units will prefer armor with good defence from armor-piercing).</li>
        <li>Mount with greater capacity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>What if two units wants same item?</b></p>
      <p>Generally, unit with bigger bonus from the item will take first. If units 
        receive equal bonus, older &quot;veteran&quot; with higher skill levels 
        will take first. </p>
      <p><b>When Needs modify orders?</b></p>
      <p>Needs will not be redistributed on each order processing, because that's 
        time-consuming process. They will be actually redistributed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On game startup (when new turn loaded and no saved order file found)</li>
        <li>When you declaring needs from environment, either by &quot;Declare 
          Needs&quot;, &quot;Add to Needs&quot; or by entering monthlong order 
          in auto-set Needs mode</li>
        <li> When &quot;Specials | Distribute Needs&quot; selected from unit popup</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="Routes"></a>Routes</h3>
      <p>Route is the path unit should constantly follow. Best example is a trade 
        caravan: it may walk 20 hexes north, then 5 hexes south-east, return back, 
        and then repeat the route. With this feature, caravan will cover optimal 
        distances each turn, without any manual kicks.</p>
      <p>To set a route for unit, you should add &quot;@;route&quot; comment to 
        its orders. You may do it manually or select &quot;Specials | Declare 
        Route&quot; from unit menu. In latter case, define route on map like normal 
        movement. Hold Ctrl to command unit to stop in clicked region; double-click 
        to finish route. Ctrl+double-click will finish route and make it one-way.</p>
      <p><b>Format of the declaration</b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999">@;route</font></b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999"> 
        [<b>oneway</b>] [move_order] (region_coords) path[: position]</font></p>
      <p><b>oneway</b> means this path sholdn't be repeated. If this token present, 
        route will be removed when unit found himself in final region. Without 
        it, unit will repeat route, if it begins and ends in same region.</p>
      <p><b>move_order</b> should be one of: move, advance, or sail.</p>
      <p><b>region_coords</b> defines starting region, like it appears in report: 
        &quot;1,1&quot; for surface or &quot;1,1,underworld&quot; for underworld.</p>
      <p><b>path</b> is sequence of directions, like for MOVE command. Directions 
        should be separated with spaces; if you'll insert comma after direction, 
        unit will stop after this move, even if it can move further.</p>
      <p><b>position</b> is the automatically maintained number of current move; 
        normally you shouldn't change it.</p>
      <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999">@;route (10,10) 
        N N NE, SW S S</font></p>
      <p>Move three regions and stop there (to get some goods). In the next turn, 
        move back and stop in starting region. Then repeat.</p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999">@;route sail 
        (10,10) N N, S S: 1</font></p>
      <p>Sail two regions north, stop there, then return and repeat. Ship already 
        made one move north and now should make one more move to reach &quot;comma 
        region&quot;.</p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999999">@;route oneway 
        (5,5,underworld) S 1 IN N N</font></p>
      <p>Move through shaft, walk a little, and stay there.</p>
      <p><b>When Routes modify orders?</b></p>
      <p>Routes will not be ran on each order processing. They will be actually 
        processed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On game startup (when new turn loaded and no saved order file found)</li>
        <li>When you declaring route by selecting &quot;Specials | Declare Route&quot; 
          (only selected unit will be processed)</li>
        <li>When &quot;Specials | Run Route&quot; selected from unit popup.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="Caravan"></a>Setting up a Caravan</h3>
      <p>Here is an example of automatic trade caravan between town and production 
        region two hexes north. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In Town we have: taxing Guards and Smiths producing swords. </li>
        <li>In Mines we have: Miners digging iron and Ranchers breeding livestock.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We want to regularly move some money from Guards to Mines to support 
        workers, and bring back their production. Guards should keep all goods, 
        sell required amount of livestock and give to Smiths required amount of 
        iron to maintain optimal production ratio.</p>
      <p>So, let's declare needs and set orders for these units:</p>
      <table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
        <tr> 
          <td width="59" valign="top">Guards</td>
          <td width="390"> <b>@;needs</b> all uneeded livestock, all unneeded 
            iron, priority 1<br>
            <b>@;needs</b> 5000 silver<br>
            @sell all livestock<br>
            @tax </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width="59" valign="top">Smith</td>
          <td width="390"><b>@;needs</b> 1 hammer, 3 iron<br>
            @produce swords</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width="59" valign="top">Miners</td>
          <td width="390"><b>@;needs</b> enough picks, all silver<br>
            @produce iron</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td width="59" valign="top">Ranchers</td>
          <td width="390"><b>@;needs</b> enough lassoes, all silver<br>
            @produce livestock</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Now, we'll create new unit - Caravan. We'll set circular route to move 
        from town to mines, stop, exchange goods, and then go back. </p>
      <table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
        <tr> 
          <td width="65" valign="top">Caravan</td>
          <td width="419"> 
            <p><b>@;route</b> (10,10) N N, S S<br>
              <b>@;needs</b> 1000 unneeded silver, all unneeded iron, all unneeded 
              livestock <br>
              <b>@;needs</b> 10 horses, 50 silver, priority 1</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>So, Caravan will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Exchange silver. In Town, Guards declared needs to 5000 silver, all 
          other silver they have is unneeded. So Caravan will take up to 1000 
          silver to pay workers. In Mines, all silver is needed, so either Miners 
          or Ranchers will take money from Caravan. Note that Caravan also has 
          50 silver as highly needed - that's its own maintenance fee, noone will 
          take it.</li>
        <li>Take unneeded items from workers. They needs only silver and tools, 
          all produced goods are unneeded. In Town, Guards needs same items, but 
          with higher priority, so they'll take all. Smith needs 3 iron each turn, 
          so it'll take it from Guards when necessary.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="RedirNew"></a>Redirecting &quot;new&quot; orders</h3>
      <p>When you creating new unit, you don't know in advance its real number 
        and must use alias, like &quot;new 1&quot;. The problem is, if you want 
        to teach the unit more than one turn (or do something like this), you 
        must correct the TEACH order in next turn after creation, when unit receives 
        real number. Advisor can handle this automatically. To do it, &quot;@;new 
        &lt;number&gt;&quot; token will be supplied to each newly-created unit. 
        In next turn, Advisor will look for these tokens and correct orders of 
        other units according to token owners' real numbers. Then tokens will 
        be removed.</p>
      <p>To enable this mode, set &quot;Redirect &quot;new&quot; orders&quot; 
        in Options.</p>
      <p class="section">Turn Analyzers</p>
      <h2>Turn Analyzers</h2>
      <h3><a name="Tracking"></a>Unit tracking</h3>
      <p>Advisor keeps track of all units met in game by their numbers. For each 
        unit, it records its faction and magical talent.</p>
      <p>Faction recording works in following way. You have observer in region, 
        and see unit from Some Faction. In next turn, observer moves out, and 
        you see only unit, but not faction. Advisor will show the recorded faction 
        for you, but it will be marked with <b>?</b>, and whole unit row will 
        be shown in colors of unknown faction.</p>
      <p>Also, Advisor will attempt to record and show unit's faction if it was 
        revealed in battle.</p>
      <p>Unit will be considered mage, if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's your unit, and it knows some magic skills</li>
        <li>It is one-leader unit of other faction, <b>and:</b> 
          <ol>
            <li>Your mages spotted monthlong casts from this unit (they appeared 
              in turn events); or</li>
            <li>It was once met in battle, casted something, and this cast seems 
              to wasn't produced by controlled monsters or battle items. To filter 
              casts from battle items (staves etc), mark them as Magic in Item 
              Editor and supply text of spell produced.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mages are marked with mage head near unit name.</p>
      <h3><a name="AnalyzingResources"></a>Analyzing Resources</h3>
      <p>Consider example. You have expert miner in mountain region, and he is 
        not found a mithril. Now you know that this region surely not contain 
        a mithril. Such inexistant resources are remembered in Advisor and shown 
        in strikeout font in Products on Region information. This analysis requires 
        following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The terrain potentially may contain the resource (this may be set 
          up in Terrain Editor);</li>
        <li>Resource is marked as Advanced Resource and has production skill defined;</li>
        <li>Units with the skill are present in region.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your explorers found in region some unexpected advanced resource, 
        it will be included in list for that terrain.</p>
      <h3><a name="SpyReports"></a>Spy Reports</h3>
      <p>This window are available at Tools. Feature allows you to view activity 
        of other factions on visible territories. It requires two or more turns 
        loaded at same time. Basically, Advisor will try to find all units visible 
        on current turn in previous turns and compare previous unit state with 
        current one. So, you may spot appeared and disappeared (either moving 
        or killed in battle) units, changes in unit parameters and inventory. 
      </p>
      <p>Last type if information - &quot;economy&quot; - is special. That's not 
        direct unit events, but rather statistical calculations for regions. For 
        example, if you have 10 level 1 entertainers in region with Entertainment 
        Available $200, you expect them to collect exactly $200. And if you got 
        in events &quot;Earns 180 silver entertaining...&quot;, this means that 
        someone else is entertaining in region. Advisor will deduct approximate 
        skill of unknown labourers, in our example that's (200 / 180 * (200 - 
        180)) / 20 = level 1. Note that this feature works only in overloaded 
        economy, when you get less than expected.</p>
      <p>Here is the explanation for tool buttons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First row of buttons filters information by type.</li>
        <li><b>Selected Region</b> shows info from selected region only.</li>
        <li><b>Selected Unit</b> shows info from selected unit, if that was unit 
          of non-player faction. You may initialize this mode by selecting &quot;Spy 
          Report&quot; from unit menu.</li>
        <li><b>All loaded turns</b> performs compare not only for last turn, but 
          for all turns currently loaded.</li>
        <li><b>Faction box</b> filters events by faction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="section">Features</p>
      <h2><a name="Features"></a>Features</h2>
      <h3><a name="AutoLink"></a>Automatic shaft linkage</h3>
      <p>Shafts leading from one level to another, so there is no way to calculate 
        the region shaft leads to. So, target region will be recovered only when 
        scout moved through shaft. Advisor will spot this movement from scout's 
        Events and automatically record target region for the shaft. Explored 
        shaft otherwise called &quot;Linked&quot;. You may manually link a shaft 
        from Object info panel.</p>
      <p>If both source and target regions (the region scout moved from, and the 
        region it moved to) has one shaft each, both these shafts will be linked: 
        shaft from source region will lead to target region, and vice versa.</p>
      <h3><a name="SendOrder"></a>Using Send Order</h3>
      <p>Send Order command available in registered version and transfers orders 
        straight to your email client. This option relies on Simple MAPI interface. 
        Warning: it's still not too reliable and may not work at all. If you have 
        a problems, try following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure that your email slient is registered in Windows as default 
          Simple MAPI handler.</li>
        <li>Set a default account in your mail client. If you are using The Bat, 
          select Properties of an account and set "This account is default for 
          "mailto:" URLs" flag. </li>
      </ol>
      <h2></h2>
      <h3><a name="ExportMap"></a>Exporting and Importing Map</h3>
      <p>Export Map command available in File menu. It exports 
        a regions in text file, similar to region section in your 
        reports. There is two options: export whole map and export 
        only one region. In second case, you may then add another 
        regions to export file by selecting them on map and choosing 
        &quot;File | Add Current Region&quot;. Regions will be 
        exported with same options as first one. Shaft links will 
        be exported as comments.</p>
      <p>You can read exported map from your ally by selecting 
        Import Map in File menu. </p>
      <p>Advisor's exported map format is typically compatible 
        with one used in EAP AtlaClient. Users of other clients 
        may copy Advisor's map into clipboard and paste it into 
        region report for their current turn, then parse report 
        as usual.</p>
      <h3><a name="ExportMap"></a>Exporting and Importing Unit 
        Skills </h3>
      <p>Export/Import skills commands available in File menu. 
        This option helps you to establish teaching between ally 
        factions. For example, you have some mages and want an 
        ally to teach them. You exporting skills of these mages 
        to clipboard and sending them to ally. They'll look like 
        this:</p>
      <pre>!732:240
PATT 30, SPIR 30, GATE 30, EART 30, WOLF 30
@study &quot;wolf lore&quot;</pre>
      <p>Then he imports this data to his client and receives 
        full information about your mages' skills and current 
        study orders. He may also send you similar info about 
        his teacher.</p>
      <p>This format is compatible with EAP Atlaclient &quot;Export 
        Mages&quot; feature.</p>
      <h3></h3>
      <h3><a name="EditIcons"></a>Custom Graphics</h3>
      <p>Many of Advisor graphics may be customized. All custom graphics placed 
        in Advisor/Images folder and being loaded on program startup. You may 
        freely edit the files or add new. Advisor main pack comes with basic set 
        of graphics; if you want many more, download latest Image Pack.</p>
      <p>The subfolders of Images are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Icons.</b> Item and Object icons. 16x16 bmp files named after short 
          names of items (viki.bmp) or group names of objects (galleon.bmp). </li>
        <li><b>Extras.</b> Small images of races for map &quot;Status Icon | Peasants&quot; 
          mode. 10x10 bmp files named after short names of items (viki.bmp).</li>
        <li><b>Terrain.</b> Terrain images to use on map. 49x43 bmp files. This 
          folder requires terrain.ini file in following format:<br>
          <br>
          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">terrain [weather] = filename.bmp</font><br>
          Example: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">plain winter=plain_winter.bmp</font><br>
          <br>
          If there is no [weather] section, the image will be used for all weathers. 
          If a terrain also has line with [weather] section, it will be shown 
          differently on selected weather.</li>
        <li><b>Battle.</b> Unit images for battle viewer. 32x32 bmp files. This 
          folder requires battle.ini in following format:<br>
          <br>
          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[ITEMS] [skills] [mage, default] 
          = filename.bmp[+mask.bmp] [filename2.bmp] [.style]</font><br>
          <br>
          Mask is optional image to draw faction color on units (must be monochrome 
          black &amp; white bmp).<br>
          Tokens in CAPITAL are item short names, like VIKI. Tokens in regular 
          letters are skills, like &quot;combat&quot;, &quot;tactics&quot;. &quot;Mage&quot; 
          is special token, meaning unit casted something in the battle. &quot;Default&quot; 
          line used as default. So, line &quot;VIKI SWOR combat&quot; will provide 
          image for trained vikings with swords. Unit will take image from first 
          matching definition, even if there is other matches.<br>
          If there is multiple filenames, pictures will be drawn over each other, 
          last will appear on top. For example, you may draw man, then armor, 
          then weapon.<br>
          Instead of name, you may define style and then include another section 
          named after style, containing additional definitions. First matching 
          definition from style section will be supplied instead of style entry. 
          For example:<br>
          <br>
          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">VIKI=peasant.bmp .def_armor<br>
          <br>
          [.def_armor]<br>
          PARM=def_parm.bmp<br>
          CARM=def_carm.bmp<br>
          </font><br>
          will draw peasant.bmp and then draw one of armor images over it, if 
          armor was found in unit.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="EditItems"></a>Editing Items, Objects and Skills</h3>
      <p>Advisor has internal editors for these things. But often there is no 
        need to enter data manually, because it will be parsed from &quot;Item 
        reports&quot;, &quot;Skill reports&quot; and &quot;Object reports&quot; 
        sections of report file. Simpliest way to set up an item is press &quot;Request 
        info&quot; button or issue SHOW ITEM command and then wait next turn report 
        with item information. Usually server automatically sends you reports 
        for items you really need.</p>
      <p>This feature, although, is highly relies on report format, which may 
        differ on different servers. There is many versions of Atlantis now, highly 
        differ in item (skill, object) reports. So if Advisor can't parse data 
        automatically, you are baned to set it up manually.</p>
      <h3><a name="AllyReports"></a>Active Faction and Ally Reports</h3>
      <p>Advisor allows only one controlled faction in one game. It will remember 
        main faction from first readed report in the game and then always use 
        it as Active Faction. But you may also load reports from other factions 
        (added in Game Manager, with your reports). Advisor will treat them as 
        Ally Reports. You will be able to see all regions, units and battles from 
        Ally Reports. Units from Ally Reports will be marked in unit grid and 
        shown with full details, but you can't give orders to them.</p>
      <h3><a name="LocalGames"></a>Local Games</h3>
      <p>You may use Atlantis server engine locally to run your own test games. 
        Advisor offers support for simple game with one faction. <b>Note:</b> 
        normally you'll not need this feature, that's useful mainly for testing 
        scripts or specific game conditions.</p>
      <p>More detailed. Atlantis server engine is simple console application which 
        takes some text files and writes some other files. Usually it collects 
        all files with player orders plus two world files, processes these and 
        then writes reports. Advisor makes this process automatic by placing order 
        and world files into right locations and running engine in proper time. 
        You should read engine help to fing more.</p>
      <p>To use this feature, do following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download Windows executable file of engine from <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/atlantisdev">AtlantisDev</a></li>
        <li>In Game Manager Options, supply path to engine</li>
        <li>Create new game with &quot;Local&quot; flag checked. Advisor will 
          run engine in &quot;create world&quot; mode. You will be prompted to 
          set up some parameters like map size. Then Advisor will run first turn 
          and load Nexus report. Note that all data files for engine are now in 
          Advisor/Game/local folder.</li>
        <li>Read this report and play it as usual.</li>
        <li>Choose &quot;File | Run next local turn&quot;. Advisor will save orders, 
          run engine to process them, and then load next turn.</li>
        <li>To rollback game to some of older turns, open Game Manager and delete 
          some new turns. Advisor will load report for last turn in Manager.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2>
      <p><b>Advisor doesn't read reports properly, there is many errors on report 
        reading, game seems to be broken (map looks wrong etc).</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Backup your reports.</li>
        <li>Unpack Advisor from installation archive to new folder</li>
        <li>Try to load Sample Game. If there was errors - something going really 
          wrong.</li>
        <li>Delete Sample Game, create new one. Add the report with errors.</li>
        <li>If there is still errors - email me. Attach erroneous report and describe 
          problem. I will <i>never</i> show your report to anyone else.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Would you give me the source code to make this and that, I'll not 
        give it to anyone!</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I would not. Or at least you must tell me <i>really</i> good reasons 
          to do so. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Advisor reads only three last reports, all other seems to be lost</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Report files are still in game/reports folder. All valuable data (map, 
          skill reports etc) from the archived reports was written to game.dat 
          for faster access. If you want to read more than three reports at a 
          time, set the amount at Options | Manager.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>I do not understand what's this scripts about!</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not use scripts. </li>
